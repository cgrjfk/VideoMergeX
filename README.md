### 🍪 How to Obtain Cookies

**Method 1: Browser Extension (Recommended)**

1. Log in to the target website using your browser.
2. Install a cookie export extension such as:
  Chrome / Edge: *Get cookies.txt*
  Firefox: *cookies.txt*
3. Open the target website page.
4. Export cookies as a `cookies.txt` file.
5. Manually import the file into the application.

This method provides the highest compatibility and stability.

**Method 2: Automatic Browser Extraction (Optional)**

The application can attempt to automatically extract cookies from supported browsers.
Administrator privileges are required, and compatibility depends on browser versions.
If extraction fails, the application will automatically fall back to cookie-less mode.

### 🛠️ Cookie Usage Notes

Manual cookie import is strongly recommended to ensure reliable access to member-only or restricted videos. While running the application with administrator privileges allows automatic cookie extraction from supported browsers, this functionality is limited to certain older browser versions due to browser security restrictions. If extraction fails, the application will automatically fall back to cookie-less download mode.
